1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

* Increasing the number of hidden nodes can initially improve the model's accuracy as it can capture more complex patterns. However, after a certain point, it may lead to overfitting where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

* Accuracy typically increases with the number of hidden nodes up to an optimal point, beyond which the accuracy may plateau or even decrease due to overfitting.
